# 🚀 Data Structures & Algorithms in C

Welcome to my DSA repository!

This repository contains my implementations of fundamental **Data Structures and Algorithms** written in pure C.  
It reflects my consistent practice and understanding of core algorithmic concepts from scratch.

---

## 🛠️ Language Used
- C Programming Language
- Standard C Libraries (stdio.h, stdlib.h, etc.)

---

## 📂 Implemented Algorithms

### 🔁 Sorting Algorithms
- ✅ Bubble Sort
- ✅ Selection Sort
- ✅ Insertion Sort
- ✅ Merge Sort
- ✅ Quick Sort
- ✅ Heap Sort

Each algorithm is implemented manually without using built-in shortcuts to deeply understand:
- Algorithm design
- Time complexity
- Space complexity
- Memory handling
- Internal working logic

| Algorithm        | Best Case     | Average Case   | Worst Case     |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| Bubble Sort     | O(n)         | O(n²)          | O(n²)          |
| Selection Sort  | O(n²)        | O(n²)          | O(n²)          |
| Insertion Sort  | O(n)         | O(n²)          | O(n²)          |
| Merge Sort      | O(n log n)   | O(n log n)     | O(n log n)     |
| Quick Sort      | O(n log n)   | O(n log n)     | O(n²)          |
| Heap Sort       | O(n log n)   | O(n log n)     | O(n log n)     |
